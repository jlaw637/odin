    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain off any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped onion and minced garlic to the skillet with the beef. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the onion is soft.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, beef broth, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper to the skillet. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce for 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens and the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain the noodles and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large baking dish, spread a layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta cheese, a layer of mozzarella cheese, and a layer of Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake at 375°F (190°C) for 25-30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10-15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
